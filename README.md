### Audio/Video Playback

Testing out audio/video playback using [`{nara}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/nara) 
and [`{governor}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/governor) 

**For linux users**, you will need to ensure you have `portaudio` installed (`apt-get install portaudio19-dev`)
and also possibly re-install the `{audio}` package.

No audio on github README pages, so please download and run `rick.R`
